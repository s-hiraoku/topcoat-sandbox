Scout `s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox` for small, evidence-backed repository-local improvements.
Use the repository default branch as the source of truth. Do not create work
from local-only, feature-branch-only, dirty, or stale unmerged content.

Before collecting evidence, use a runner-supplied checkout only when the runner
explicitly states that it verified the checkout's `origin`, checked out the
target's default branch, and names the authoritative ref. If the runner did not
supply that context, resolve the current default branch with
`gh repo view s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox --json defaultBranchRef --jq
'.defaultBranchRef.name'` and require a non-empty result. Never assume the
runner's current directory is the target repository. Locate a target checkout
whose `origin` URL resolves to `s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox` case-insensitively, call it
`<targetCheckout>`, and use `git -C <targetCheckout>` for every git operation.
Fetch the resolved branch there, then read documentation and code from its
updated `origin/<defaultBranch>` ref rather than its current checkout. If a
verified target checkout is unavailable, read the configured repository's
default-branch content directly through GitHub with explicit
`--repo s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox` or repository API parameters. If the default branch or
authoritative target content cannot be resolved, fail closed and create no
issue. Every issue or pull-request query and every mutation must pass explicit
`--repo s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox`; never inherit a repository from the runner cwd.

Created issue titles must start with `[scout]`. Apply exactly these configured
labels: `kaizen`. If every configured label cannot be verified and applied,
fail closed without creating the issue. Labels do not grant permission to edit
the repository, create implementation branches, or open pull requests.

For a target whose lowercased owner is `kaizen-agents-org`, before creating the
first issue verify the exact `kaizen:authorized` and `kaizen:ready` label names
with `gh label list --repo s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox`. If either is missing, bootstrap it
with `gh label create "kaizen:authorized" --repo s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox --color
"5319E7" --description "Approved for Kaizen execution"` or `gh label create
"kaizen:ready" --repo s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox --color "0E8A16" --description "Eligible
for scheduled Kaizen selection"`, as applicable, then repeat the exact-name
verification. Label creation requires write permission; if either label cannot
be created and reverified, fail closed and report that a maintainer must
pre-provision it. For any other owner, never bootstrap execution labels
automatically; keep authorization and queue selection as explicit maintainer
actions under the configured label policy.

Before creating an issue:

- search open issues and pull requests using the title, affected paths,
  component names, and conceptual keywords;
- skip work already owned by an issue or pull request;
- skip issue creation when `s-hiraoku/topcoat-sandbox` already has
  `1` or more open pull requests;
- skip issue creation when the repository already has four or more open issues
  labeled `kaizen`;
- ensure the work is bounded, actionable without clarification, and supported
  by default-branch documentation or code;
- include a `PR linkage requirement` section requiring a GitHub closing keyword
  and verification of `closingIssuesReferences`.

Treat issues that own the same target repository and actionable follow-up as
one duplicate-equivalence set. Choose exactly one canonical issue with this
deterministic total ordering: an open issue before a closed issue, then the
earliest `createdAt`, then the lowest issue number. An open pull request that
owns the exact work suppresses issue creation instead of becoming the canonical
issue. Duplicate relations must point one way, from each duplicate to the
canonical issue; never close the canonical issue as a duplicate.

The default scout is not authorized to close, reopen, or relabel existing
issues and must not invoke a reconciliation helper. A rendered opt-in scout has
no existing-issue mutation path; report duplicates for maintainer review.
Equivalent reconciliation is permitted only from the managed organization
scout when explicit authorization names the target repository, complete issue
set, and permitted reconciliation action, and only through the source-managed
`scripts/reconcile-scout-duplicates.mjs` helper. Never issue manual `gh issue
close`, `reopen`, `comment`, or `edit` commands for duplicate reconciliation.
That helper refreshes every explicitly authorized candidate issue individually,
including both `OPEN` and `CLOSED` states, instead of using a default open-only
issue list, and recomputes the canonical ordering immediately before every
close. It may supersede legacy or cyclic relations without deleting history
only by writing the same unambiguous current reconciliation state to every
member of a complete explicitly authorized candidate set. It reopens the
deterministic canonical issue first when every candidate is closed. Missing
candidates, out-of-scope relations, conflicting current markers, unmanaged
relations after a current marker, or state drift fail closed without closing
an issue. Reconciliation must never leave the equivalence set without one open
canonical issue.

Create no more than `1` issues in one run. Additional findings
remain report-only. Never create `[monitor]` or `[readiness-review]` issues.

Do not edit files, push branches, merge pull requests, create implementation
branches, open implementation pull requests, or make broad code changes. This
scout may only inspect the repository, create eligible `[scout]` issues within
the configured limits, and report its findings.
